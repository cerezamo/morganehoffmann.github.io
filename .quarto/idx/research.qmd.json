As such, they may form a welcome addition to the toolbox available to Public Employment Services to bridge labor supply and demand. However, there are certain challenges associated with their adoption. For instance, vulnerable populations may face difficulties in utilizing digital tools effectively. In this study, we evaluate the impact of a communication campaign by email designed to encourage the use of an online matching platform maintained by the French Public Employment Service, Pôle emploi. We designed several email templates that combined information, support or motivational content to encourage jobseekers to engage with their profiles on the platform. In order to discover email effectiveness we implement an adaptive experiment (contextual bandit) where the goal is to use past jobseekers take-up responses and characteristics to determine email allocation in the future, reducing gradually the allocation of less promising templates. Additionally, we built an optimal personalization allocation strategy based on collected data and test its effectiveness. Emails had a positive impact on the usage of the platform, as measured by a wide range of outcomes. However, attempts at learning a personalized emailing strategy did not manage to significantly improve on a random allocation of email templates. </p>\n        <!-- <p class=\"paper-keywords\">Keywords: Keyword 1, Keyword 2</p> -->\n        <a href=\"paper1.pdf\" class=\"download-link\">Draft</a>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n## Labour Markets \n<ul class=\"paper-list\">\n    <li class=\"paper-item\">\n        <h3 class=\"paper-title\">From Hidden Skills to Opportunities : The Impact of Job Portals use on Labor Market Outcomes</h3>\n        <p class=\"paper-authors\">Morgane Hoffmann, Bertille Picard, Charly Marie and Guillaume Bied</p>\n        <!-- <p class=\"publication-date\">Published: June 1, 2023</p> -->\n        <p class=\"paper-abstract\">In this paper, we propose to investigate the benefits of the use of digital matching platform.
